            <p class="location">Holy Family Hall</p>
            
            <p>Known as our most popular tradition in the Fil-Am community, the annual Christmas party is hosted on the first Saturday of December. The party consists of food, music, and absolute fun, as well as musical performances, cultural dances, and a raffle. Starting at five and drawing close to midnight, this party is something you don't want to miss, as it only happens once a year.</p>

            <p class="location">Holy Family Hall</p>
            
            <p>Hosted around the last Wednesday of October, the St. Mary's Filipino FAN Dinner was formerly held to attract locals and to inform them more about Filipino culture. Now, the FAN Dinner doubles as a fundraiser for countries such as Haiti and the Philippines itself. Dishes cooked by fellow members of the association are brought in for all to enjoy. A few foods such as pancit (rice noodles), adobo (meat and potatoes served on rice), and lumpia (egg rolls) are offered.</p>

              <p class="location">St. Mary's Church</p>
              
              <p>Usually held early in the summertime, St. Mary's Church, the association's main parish, allows a Sunday mass intertwined with Filipino culture. A Filipino priest preaching in the area is invited to do the mass, and members of the association participate by singing in the choir or doing readings. Younger members contribute as altar servers.</p>

              <p>This newer event is hosted on the weekend of Easter. New members of the community are introduced at this time. Of course, the traditional egg hunt follows at the end, eggs hidden all over the fields surrounding the Nelson's Barn.</p>

            <p class="location">44 Gatewick Dr.</p>

            <p>This event is usually held every time Manny Pacquiao, popular Filipino boxer, has a match. Most of the time, the event happens in April, and most people come earlier than the actual fight itself. They come early to enjoy the food and to socialize with other people in the community.</p>
