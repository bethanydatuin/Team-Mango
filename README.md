WEST TENNESSEE FIL-AM ASSOCIATION README

We, Bethany Datuin and Ellison Masangcay, first started our "design journey" by taking inspiration from the website we learned to code from the course titled "CSS Basics."
The website we were creating for this competition was for the West Tennessee Fil-Am Association.
As Filipino-Americans ourselves, we wanted to create a website to show off our community and heritage.
The Philippines has a rich culture that should be shown to all.

THE WEBSITE
+++++++++++

- The information on the website has everything that the client wanted to have on it.

- The client wanted many pictures to show off how exciting and fun the association is.

- The layout I formerly intended to use was to have a full-page header with a picture of the Philippines in the background.

- A down arrow would be toward the bottom of the header to be clicked, which would scroll down to the home page.

- The color scheme I originally decided to go with for my website was a light blue, but I eventually changed it to red and a darker blue to match the flag of the Philippines.

- The font I chose was Raleway, which was an aesthetic font that is easy for anyone to read.

- The responsiveness of my site required the navigation to be narrowed down into one column.

- The photo gallery page had to be coded so that two pictures would be on each row; before, there was only one picture, making the page very long. The client wanted to have many pictures to show the events that the association held every year and the food served.

- The membership page had a form that had a watermark over it. To replace it, I had to redo the whole thing from scratch in Microsoft Word.

- The logo of the website is the logo of the Fil-Am Association.

- The favicon is said logo.
